# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Tensorflow
Introduction to Natural Language Processing
NLP is a very deep and complex field and continues to evolve day by day. Here we will introduce this topic together. We will try to solve the problem of binary text classification with the help of Tensorflow. For this purpose, we will build 6 models. These are:

* Naive Bayes (baseline)
* Simple dense layer (Introducton to Deep Learning)
* LSTM
* GRU
* Bidirectional LSTM
* CNN

In general, the processes include:
* Uploading data
* Tokenization
* Embedding
* Model building
* Extraction of model summaries
* Measuring model performance
* Comparison of results
* Visualization of results
* Verification on model validation data
* Model testing
* Finding and visualizing the most erroneous results of the model
